	* Release 0.4.0.

Changes since 0.3

	* Html2Wiki: Support for XHTML span attributes with class "bold", "italic",
	and "underline" was added.

	* Wiki2Html: Underline using XHTML strict compliant <span class="underline">
	instead of <u> tags.

Changes since 0.2

	* Html2Wiki.py: A broken unit test caused many bugs to remain undiscovered.
	The test was fixed, the linebreak-handling of the class was reworked and some
	other bugs were also fixed. You should particulary notice a much higher
	reliability when converting between wiki markup and HTML multiple times.
	Prepending a "!" before a WikiWord now prevents it from being linked.
	URL captions now allow more characters.
	Links are now made by enclosing them in square brackets (no longer curly
	brackets).
	Support for preformatted text with the #Text/#End tag was added.
	Improved recognition of external URLs.

Changes since 0.1

	* Wiki2Html.py: Now also works with windows line breaks. Line break handling
	has also bee improved in other cases. The _underline_ tag now underlines, it
	no longer strikes through the text.
	The #Table tag has been removed, tables work now only by using the #Heading
	and #Row tags.
	Headings now support additional characters, like punctuation, slashes,
	dashes, etc.
	(set_wiki_word_handler): New method, provides a hook into the new WikiWord
	parser.
	(set_url_handler): New method, provides a hook into the new URL parser.

	* Html2Wiki.py: Added support for hyperlinks. Changed to reflect the changes
	in Wiki2Html.py.

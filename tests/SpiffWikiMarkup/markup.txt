= Wiki Markup =

== Links to other pages ==

Link to other pages in the same Wiki: ->Simple or CamelCaseWords
Link to other pages on your homepage: [admin/users] or [admin/users This is my link!]
Link to external pages: [http://debain.org] or [http://debain.org This is an external link!]

== Text styles ==

This line has /italic text/. The following, however, will not have any effect: test1/test2/test3
*Strong* text is enclosed by stars.
You might also want to _underline_ something.
You might add some marked up text /even if it contains _other markup_ or spans over *multiple lines*/.

#Text
== Test ==

def code_start(self, text): [blah/huh asdasd]
    pass
#End

== Tables ==

A table is a little more sophisticated, but still pretty easy:

#Heading
  | Row number
  | Heading 1
  | Heading /with/ markup
  | Heading 3
#Row
  | #
  | More text 1
  | More text 2
  | More text 3
#Row
  | # ||| This text spans over multiple cells.

Note that tables do not require a heading, the #Heading tag is optional.

== Lists ==

A simple numbered list:

# Line 1
# Second one
# Another one.

Unnumbered list:

* Yes yes
* This may work.
* It might also not work.

As you might have seen in the table example above, you can also use tables as
lists. Cells that contain only a hash ("#") are automatically replaced by a
counter. For example:

#Row
  | # | Name:         | Samuel
#Row
  | # | Last Name:    | Abels
#Row
  | # | Homepage:     | [http://debain.org]
#Row
  | # | Email:        | Look [http://debain.org/about/ here]

Ending up here, it worked nicely!
